# 4-way Video & Audio Conferencing using Sockets (Python)
This project aims to make a maximum of 4-way video & audio conferencing using sockets on Python. This project tool is intended to be used within the same network (Wi-Fi/LAN) without the need for an ISP service. This tool can be used by workers/students inside a building or campus to talk face-to-face.
